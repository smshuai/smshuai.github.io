  abstract = "The contributions of coding mutations to tumorigenesis are
              relatively well known; however, little is known about somatic
              alterations in noncoding DNA. Here we describe GECCO (Genomic
              Enrichment Computational Clustering Operation) to analyze somatic
              noncoding alterations in 308 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas
              (PDAs) and identify commonly mutated regulatory regions. We find
              recurrent noncoding mutations to be enriched in PDA pathways,
              including axon guidance and cell adhesion, and newly identified
              processes, including transcription and homeobox genes. We
              identified mutations in protein binding sites correlating with
              differential expression of proximal genes and experimentally
              validated effects of mutations on expression. We developed an
              expression modulation score that quantifies the strength of gene
              regulation imposed by each class of regulatory elements, and
              found the strongest elements were most frequently mutated,
              suggesting a selective advantage. Our detailed single-cancer
              analysis of noncoding alterations identifies regulatory mutations
              as candidates for diagnostic and prognostic markers, and suggests
              new mechanisms for tumor evolution.",

  abstract = "Cancers are caused by genomic alterations known as drivers.
              Hundreds of drivers in coding genes are known but, to date, only
              a handful of noncoding drivers have been discovered-despite
              intensive searching1,2. Attention has recently shifted to the
              role of altered RNA splicing in cancer; driver mutations that
              lead to transcriptome-wide aberrant splicing have been identified
              in multiple types of cancer, although these mutations have only
              been found in protein-coding splicing factors such as splicing
              factor 3b subunit 1 (SF3B1)3-6. By contrast, cancer-related
              alterations in the noncoding component of the spliceosome-a
              series of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs)-have barely been studied,
              owing to the combined challenges of characterizing noncoding
              cancer drivers and the repetitive nature of snRNA genes1,7,8.
              Here we report a highly recurrent A>C somatic mutation at the
              third base of U1 snRNA in several types of tumour. The primary
              function of U1 snRNA is to recognize the 5' splice site via
              base-pairing. This mutation changes the preferential A-U
              base-pairing between U1 snRNA and the 5' splice site to C-G
              base-pairing, and thus creates novel splice junctions and alters
              the splicing pattern of multiple genes-including known drivers of
              cancer. Clinically, the A>C mutation is associated with heavy
              alcohol use in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and with
              the aggressive subtype of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with
              unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable regions. The
              mutation in U1 snRNA also independently confers an adverse
              prognosis to patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Our
              study demonstrates a noncoding driver in spliceosomal RNAs,
              reveals a mechanism of aberrant splicing in cancer and may
              represent a new target for treatment. Our findings also suggest
              that driver discovery should be extended to a wider range of
              genomic regions.",

              rare in most paediatric cancers-are confined largely to
              protein-coding genes1-3. Here we report highly recurrent hotspot
              mutations (r.3A>G) of U1 spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs)
              in about 50\% of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastomas. These
              mutations were not present across other subgroups of
              medulloblastoma, and we identified these hotspot mutations in U1
              snRNA in only <0.1\% of 2,442 cancers, across 36 other tumour
              types. The mutations occur in 97\% of adults (subtype
              SHH$\delta$) and 25\% of adolescents (subtype SHH$\alpha$) with
              SHH medulloblastoma, but are largely absent from SHH
              medulloblastoma in infants. The U1 snRNA mutations occur in the

              significantly disrupted RNA splicing and an excess of 5' cryptic

              inactivates tumour-suppressor genes (PTCH1) and activates
              oncogenes (GLI2 and CCND2), and represents a target for therapy.
              These U1 snRNA mutations provide an example of highly recurrent

              resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute
              clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4-5 driver mutations
              when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however,
              in around 5\% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting
              that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis,
              in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single
              catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour
              evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede
              most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated
              genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance
              often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and

              for understanding tumorigenesis and developing therapies.
              Exome-sequencing studies have mapped many protein-coding drivers,
              yet few non-coding drivers are known because genome-wide
              discovery is challenging. We developed a driver discovery method,
              ActiveDriverWGS, and analyzed 120,788 cis-regulatory modules
              (CRMs) across 1,844 whole tumor genomes from the ICGC-TCGA PCAWG
              project. We found 30 CRMs with enriched SNVs and indels (FDR <
              0.05). These frequently mutated regulatory elements (FMREs) were
              ubiquitously active in human tissues, showed long-range chromatin
              interactions and mRNA abundance associations with target genes,
              and were enriched in motif-rewiring mutations and structural
              variants. Genomic deletion of one FMRE in human cells caused
              proliferative deficiencies and transcriptional deregulation of
              cancer genes CCNB1IP1, CDH1, and CDKN2B, validating observations
              in FMRE-mutated tumors. Pathway analysis revealed further
              sub-significant FMREs at cancer genes and processes, indicating
              an unexplored landscape of infrequent driver mutations in the
              non-coding genome.",

              has greatly expanded in the past decade. However, non-coding
              cancer driver mutations are less well-characterized and only a
              handful of recurrent non-coding mutations, most notably TERT
              promoter mutations, have been reported. Here, as part of the
              ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG)
              Consortium, which aggregated whole genome sequencing data from
              2658 cancer across 38 tumor types, we perform multi-faceted
              pathway and network analyses of non-coding mutations across 2583
              whole cancer genomes from 27 tumor types compiled by the
              ICGC/TCGA PCAWG project that was motivated by the success of
              pathway and network analyses in prioritizing rare mutations in
              protein-coding genes. While few non-coding genomic elements are
              recurrently mutated in this cohort, we identify 93 genes
              harboring non-coding mutations that cluster into several modules
              of interacting proteins. Among these are promoter mutations
              associated with reduced mRNA expression in TP53, TLE4, and TCF4.
              We find that biological processes had variable proportions of
              coding and non-coding mutations, with chromatin remodeling and
              proliferation pathways altered primarily by coding mutations,
              while developmental pathways, including Wnt and Notch, altered by
              both coding and non-coding mutations. RNA splicing is primarily
              altered by non-coding mutations in this cohort, and samples
              containing non-coding mutations in well-known RNA splicing
              factors exhibit similar gene expression signatures as samples
              with coding mutations in these genes. These analyses contribute a
              new repertoire of possible cancer genes and mechanisms that are
              altered by non-coding mutations and offer insights into
              additional cancer vulnerabilities that can be investigated for
              potential therapeutic treatments.",

              genomics studies, creating the need for a resource of lncRNAs

              whether mutated lncRNAs can drive tumorigenesis, and whether such

              compilation of 122 GENCODE lncRNAs with causal roles in cancer
              phenotypes. In contrast to existing databases, CLC requires
              strong functional or genetic evidence. CLC genes are enriched
              amongst driver genes predicted from somatic mutations, and
              display characteristic genomic features. Strikingly, CLC genes
              are enriched for driver mutations from unbiased, genome-wide
              transposon-mutagenesis screens in mice. We identified 10
              tumour-causing mutations in orthologues of 8 lncRNAs, including
              LINC-PINT and NEAT1, but not MALAT1. Thus CLC represents a
