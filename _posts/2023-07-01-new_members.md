Also, three new members have joined the lab and we are excited to welcome them aboard! Rongquan Xiao has joined us a research assistant professor and he will make sure that our wet lab runs smoothly. Yongwei Zhu and Yueshan Liang have joined us as visiting scientist and visiting student respectively; they will spend their summer with us to have fun with some cool projects. We are confident that their skills and expertise will help us achieve our goals.
