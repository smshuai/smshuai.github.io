    Yining was born in Wuzhou, Guangxi, China (the birthplace of Cantonese, historically known as Guangxin, at the border between Guangdong and Guangxi). She received her BSc in Bioinformatics from Hunan Agricultural University, and her MSc in Biology from SUSTech. After joining COmics Lab for her PhD, she continues bioinformatics research to explore liver cancer splicing. As an ‘experienced SUSTecher’, Yining has her own rhythm of life. Her wishes are to publish papers and healthily improve her badminton skills. Besides conducting serious scientific research, she proudly represents SUSTech in the badminton team and hopes to continue her hobby and speciality in her PhD. So, if you like to play badminton, don't forget to invite her. Although Yining’s MBTI is ENFP (‘happy puppies’), she prefers kittens. Her pet is a female blue bicolor Ragdoll cat named Cookie.

    懿宁来自广西梧州（粤语发源地，古时称广信，处于两广交界）。她本科毕业于湖南农业大学，获生物信息学专业理学学士学位；硕士毕业于南方科技大学，获生物学专业理学硕士学位。博士加入COmics Lab后，她继续从事Dry Lab研究，进行可变剪切调控肝癌的课题探索。作为一名“老南科人”，懿宁有自己的生活节奏，她的愿望是发paper和健康涨球。在认真开展科研之余，她在羽毛球队为校争光，希望博士阶段能延续自己的爱好特长。所以，喜欢打羽毛球的各位，一定别忘了叫上她。虽然是“快乐小狗”（ENFP），但是懿宁更喜欢小猫。她的爱宠是一只名为曲奇（Cookie）的蓝双布偶妹妹。
