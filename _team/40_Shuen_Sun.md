bio: >
    Shuen grew up in Shenzhen, Guangdong (though her love for spicy food makes her feel more like a "fake" Guangdong native). After completing her undergraduate studies in Beijing, she transitioned from mathematics and statistics to data science. She’s eager to dive deeper into the interdisciplinary field of biomedical research and hopes to further explore the world of COmics in the future. Beyond her academic pursuits, she’s passionate about tennis and is determined to improve her skills. She also enjoys playing badminton, so don’t forget to invite her for a match! At home, she loves gaming and has a soft spot for cats and dogs. She has a younger sister named Fa Fa (a puppy). If you think she's a bit "E", you’d never guess that she’s actually an INFP.
