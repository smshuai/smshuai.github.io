bio: >
    Yunsu is from Yibin, Sichuan, and graduated from Guangxi University in 2024. She loves spicy food and Zhe’ergen (a Sichuan specialty), enjoys listening to Taylor Swift and Lana Del Rey, and is fond of city walks. As for sports, she “forced” herself to run every day during her undergraduate years, but she really dislikes running. In her childhood, she learned a bit of tennis, enjoys playing badminton, and likes playing soccer (though she’s not very good at it). She’s a slow-to-warm-up person, so if you think she’s quiet, you’ve been fooled…

    韵苏是四川宜宾人，2024年毕业于广西大学。她喜欢吃辣的食物和折耳根，喜欢听Taylor Swift和Lana Del Rey的歌，喜欢City Walk。至于体育运动，她本科期间曾“强迫”自己每天跑步，不过她真的很讨厌跑步。她小时候学过一点网球，喜欢打羽毛球，更喜欢踢足球（很菜）。她是一个慢热的人，如果你觉得她很安静，那么你就被骗了......
