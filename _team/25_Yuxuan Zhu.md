bio: >
    Yu Xuan comes from Yulin, Guangxi. She graduated from the Department of Biological Sciences at Beijing Normal University with a bachelor's degree. In addition, she also studied psychology as a minor. She is very happy to join the COmics family and embark on the next stage of exploration and learning. Although she thinks slowly, she has a lot of things she wants to try and doesn't want to miss out on. In her free time, in addition to playing video games, she is also learning ukulele, digital painting creation, and Korean. She is not very good at sports, but likes to join in the fun. She played baseball for three years during her undergraduate studies. She is a slow burner when it comes to personality and hopes to get along well with everyone and make progress together :p

    雨萱来自广西玉林，本科毕业于北京师范大学生物科学专业，此外还辅修了心理学。很高兴能加入COmics大家庭，进行下一阶段的探索与学习。虽然脑子转得慢，但有很多想尝试的事情，不想错过。空闲时间除了打游戏，还在学习尤克里里、板绘创作和韩语。不太擅长运动，但是喜欢凑热闹，本科打了三年的垒球。性格比较慢热，希望以后能和大家好好相处，一起进步:p
