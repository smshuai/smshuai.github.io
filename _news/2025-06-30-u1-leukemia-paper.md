Weâ€™re happy to share that our collaborative study led by **Dr. Ferran Nadeu** and **Dr. ElÃ­as Campo** (IDIBAPS), with COmics PI **Dr. Shimin Shuai** as a co-first author, has been published in *Leukemia*!  

![Graphical Abstract](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41375-025-02667-7/MediaObjects/41375_2025_2667_Figa_HTML.png?as=webp)

In this work, we provide the first **pan-B-cell neoplasm catalog of U1 spliceosomal RNA mutations**, analyzing over 2,000 samples across **chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)** and several **mature B-cell lymphomas**.

### Highlights:
- Validated our previous discovery (Shuai et al., *Nature*, 2019) of a recurrent **g.3A>C** U1 mutation in ~3.5% of CLL, linked to **accelerated disease progression**
- Identified a novel **g.9C>T** U1 mutation in CLL, associated with **poor clinical outcomes**
- Discovered **tumor-subtype-specific U1 hotspot mutations** in **DLBCL (g.4C>T)** and **Burkitt lymphoma (g.7A>G)**, each driving distinct **splicing alterations**

This study establishes **U1 as a driver gene in multiple mature B-cell malignancies**, providing new insights into splicing dysregulation and cancer biology.
