The **COmics Lab** is led by [Shimin Shuai, PhD](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/facultys/shiminshuai.html){:target="\_blank"}, and is a part of the Department of Human Cell Biology and Genetics, School of Medicine, [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/){:target="\_blank"} at Shenzhen, China. We work at the intersection of biomedical science and data science, and we aim to **develop computational tools for and generate biological insights from large and novel omics data**!
